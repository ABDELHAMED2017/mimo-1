This is simple code to calculate spatial correlation for SCME UMA.  The main purpose of this code is for people who work on MIMO OTA can get a deeper look at the details of spatial channel model.


**Prerequisite:**

1. Python 2.7.x

2. matplotlib 1.4.x (if running animation.py)


**Usage:**

Retrieve git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/ETS-Lindgren/mimo.git
```

Then run
```
cd mimo
python SCME_UMA.py
```

There is a simple animation to show how signals start to deviate from the center.  Simply run
'''
cd mimo
python animation.py
'''
